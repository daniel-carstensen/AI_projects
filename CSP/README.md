# Guide to CSP Classes
Testing the code is pretty straightforward. Simply run the test_CSP.py file and the outputs will be printed in the console.<br>
To create new test cases, create a text file and follow the formatting of the existing text files.<br>
For new maps, either let each line contain a node and its neighbors separated by commas, or
write all nodes in the first line and write one undirected edge for each following line. Separate by a space.<br>
For new circuits, input the length and height of each component into a new line, separated by commas.
