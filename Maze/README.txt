# Purpose : Explanation of programs

To run this program, please refer to test_mazeworld.py and test_sensorless.py
Test cases are already programmed and the output will be written into an output file.

Both test programs have already been run and the output files are included (multirobot_test_results.txt
and sensorless_test_results.txt). There also exists a screen capture of an animated solution to the sensorless problem
(sensorless_animated.mov).

If you wish to randomly generate a new maze, please run mazeGenerator.py with your requested height and width.
A new .maz file will be generated which you may edit and implement in the test programs.
