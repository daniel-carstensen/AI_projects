# Guide to Chess Alogrithms
To use MinimaxAI.py and AlphaBetaAI.py, simply instantiate them as players
with a specified maximum depth.<br>
You can use either test_chess.py or gui_chess.py to do so.<br>
To use IterativeDeepening.py, look at the test code at the bottom of
the program.<br>
You can simply instantiate the IterativeDeepening class with MinimaxAI or AlphaBetaAI
and run the methods as specified in the sample code.<br>

## Extra Credit
Lastly, to use CachedAlphaBetaAI.py, instantiate it as a player with a specified maximum depth
and a specified maximum size of the cache. It can then be used in the same way as 
MinimaxAI or AlphaBetaAI.
